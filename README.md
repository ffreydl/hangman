Hangman challenges players to guess a hidden word, letter by letter, before the hangman drawing is completed. 

### 1. **The Hidden Word:**
   - A randomly chosen word is represented by underscores (`_`).

### 2. **Guessing Letters:**
   - Players guess one letter at a time to reveal the word.

### 3. **Feedback on Guesses:**
   - Correct guesses reveal the letter, wrong guesses build the hangman drawing.

### 4. **Winning and Losing:**
   - Win by revealing the entire word, or lose by completing the hangman drawing.
